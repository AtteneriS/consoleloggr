                <li>Finished lesson 6 (basic CSS I aplied here)</li>
                <li>Did the whole CSS selectors lesson (Section 7)</li>
                <li>Maybe did some of lesson 8?</li>
                <li>Didn't track properly. I was super motivated at first, then as usual got sidetracked by other things
                    and didn't even realise how long I went without doing a single lesson.</li>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>I came into this first week fully motivated. I was *finally* going to sit down and get it done, not like
                the two hundred previous times I told myself the same thing. This time I had <strong>THE
                    method</strong>. Yeah. Turned out it was the same old story with new sparkles.</p>
            <p>I don't know how I keep falling for my own ‚Äúorganize-and-find-new-methods‚Äù lies as a way of feeling
                productive. You'd think that by now I'd have learned my lesson? But nope.</p>
            <p>Well, I started the week strong, doing the basic CSS and thinking "I got this". I got cocky. Once I got
                into selectors, pseudo-classes, and the cascade itself, I started thinking about my *next steps* once I
                finished this course. Because... why not?</p>

            <p>This course is <em>soooo</em> easy.</p>

            <p>So I went: I need to study more CSS, supplement this course, jump into TOP, maybe CS50? I'd love to get
                into cybersecurity. Let's ask some AI chatbot for a roadmap, look up resources, success stories, and
                people coming into it from unconventional backgrounds. No, wait, you know what? I should study web dev +
                cybersecurity + AI or ML. All at the same time. YEAH! What a great idea. You are a genius! *pats her own
                back*</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>Girl. <strong>What?</strong> Go tf back to your little course. You are on lesson 6 out of SEVENTY-FOUR.
                Stop the grandiose daydreaming and <em>do something</em> for once, please.</p>

            <p>So... yeah. I genuinely can't remember where I stopped. I think I finished lessons 6 and 7, maybe 8? Who
                knows. At some point I closed the ten tabs and never opened them again until a few days ago (I'm writing
                this on June 22).</p>

            <p>Definitely not a productive week, but that's kind of why I'm writing this ‚Äî to keep myself accountable,
                even if I don't write the summaries when I intended to. That way, at some point I can either break the
                dopamine spiral of chasing new shiny things and remind myself what I'm doing and why... or break the
                shame spiral when I realize I've wasted weeks <em>again</em> and instead of wasting
                <strong>more</strong> weeks in that spiral, slap some sense into myself and come back.</p>

            <p>I want to document both the pretty and the ugly weeks. This is definitely one of the uglies. Ha.</p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

            <h3>Lessons Learned:</h3>
            <p>PLANNING IS NOT PROGRESS.</p>
            <p>Burn that into your head. For me, it'd be better to code aimlessly for a week than to finish a single
                20-minute video and then plan for 4 hours about what apprenticeship I'm going to take or whether I
                should join a startup.</p>

            <p>You have a course. That's the path. Follow it. You'll think about what comes later... well... later. This
                is just procrastination with extra steps.</p>

            <h3>Frustration Level:</h3>
            <p>8/10 ‚Äî but more frustrated with myself than the material.</p>
            <p>Kind of happy with how my mediocre CSS looks here though.</p>
